This is my online digital garden where I collect my thoughts about various interesting things, in the hope that they grow from ideas into longer form writings, projects or works. I am also trying to aggregate my life a bit, and link to all the various places I am or have been uploading things over the years. 

You can find some of those things [here]([https://linktr.ee/fionatkeenan](https://linktr.ee/fionatkeenan)).
