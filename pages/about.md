Hello reader. I am a writer, researcher and teacher with a creative practice in sound and music and a growing preoccupation with personal knowledge management (PKM) and archival practice in the age of large language models (LLMs). I also am a late-realised autistic woman. The process of figuring this out about myself, and getting my autism diagnosis in my early 40s, has profoundly shifted what I think knowledge is and how I want to go about creating it. 

This digital [[garden::/garden]] is my attempt to integrate my interest-led autistic ways of being and doing with what I have already learned about historically situated creative technologies and their impact on us humans. But given it is interest-led, there will likely be lots of fruitful detours into other areas. I will be reckless, verbose, and agonise over every word. And hopefully grow some more fully formed [[blog]] entries as the garden matures. 

You can find my [[publications]] listed on this site. I am currently teaching at The University of York and you can view my staff profile [[here::https://www.york.ac.uk/arts-creative-technologies/people/fiona-keenan/]]. 

I also write a personal blog about autistic experience over on Substack that you can access [[here::https://howigetaround.substack.com/]]
