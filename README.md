A simple Jekyll theme that turns your Obsidian notes into a beautiful website. Perfect for sharing your thoughts and knowledge online. If you use Obsidian for note-taking, this theme makes it easy to publish your markdown files as a connected website with wiki-style links and full-text search.


### What it does

Jekyll Garden connects your notes together with simple `[[note title]]` links, just like in Obsidian. You can find any note quickly with the built-in search that works as you type. The design focuses on your content with a clean, minimal look that works great on phones, tablets, and computers. Choose between dark and light themes, and when you want to write traditional blog posts, you can do that too. The theme also supports mathematical expressions if you need to write equations.

## Getting Started

Getting started is straightforward. First, download this theme to your computer. Then edit the settings in the `_config.yml` file with your website information. Add your notes to the `_notes` folder, and finally deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any web hosting service.
